# 🐛 ASA Server Manager v2.1.1 - Bug Fix Release

**Release Date:** January 11, 2026

---

## 🔧 Bug Fixes

### 🔴 Critical Fix: Cluster Creation Error
**Issue:** "Failed to create cluster" error when trying to create a new cluster with servers.

**Cause:** The database INSERT statement was missing the required `server_ids` column, causing a NOT NULL constraint violation.

**Fix:** Updated `cluster.rs` to properly serialize and insert `server_ids` as a JSON array when creating clusters.

---

### 🔴 Critical Fix: Server Executable Not Found
**Issue:** Starting a server would fail with "Server executable not found" error if the server files weren't fully installed.

**Cause:** The app would only check for the executable and fail without offering a solution.

**Fix:** Now when you start a server and the executable is missing, the app will **automatically download and install** the server files via SteamCMD before starting. No more manual intervention needed!

---

### 🟡 Fix: RCON Console Connection Using Wrong IP
**Issue:** RCON console was hardcoded to connect to `127.0.0.1`, causing connection failures for servers with different IP addresses.

**Fix:** RCON console now uses the server's configured `ipAddress` field, falling back to `127.0.0.1` only if no IP is configured.

---

### 🟡 Fix: Dashboard Showing Wrong IP Address
**Issue:** The Server Control Hub dashboard always displayed `127.0.0.1` regardless of the server's actual configured IP.

**Fix:** Dashboard now displays the server's configured IP address correctly.

---

### 🟢 Enhancement: RCON Configuration in Settings
**Enhancement:** Added RCON settings to the Visual Settings Manager:
- **RCON Enabled** toggle - Enable/disable remote console access
- **RCON Port** slider - Configure RCON port (default: 27020)
